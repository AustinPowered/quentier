1. Connect MainWindow actions & buttons with corresponding slots (programmatically)
2. Make text format & alignment smart: on putting cursor to some place in the edit window,
set current font, size, color, format, alignment buttons and fields on the panel
to the respective ones of the text.
3. Look at "void textStyle(int styleIndex);" slot from TextEdit class from QtRichTextEditor project
4. Reconnect keyboard shortcuts on widget selection change (table of notes & editor, I suppose)
5. Change cursor style (from vertical line corresponding to editing text to the arrow) on hovering checkbox object
